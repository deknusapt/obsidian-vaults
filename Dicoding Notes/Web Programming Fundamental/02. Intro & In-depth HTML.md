Markup language that will be used to built a web pages, Hypertext Markup Language. As it says, HTML analogous as a structure. On this part will be introduce to HTML in depth.

## Root Project Directory
When creating a web pages, we only need is a project folder. Inside the folder or project directory we need a HTML file which end up with .html as extension for naming the files. 

## Structure & Anatomy
HTML has a basic structure, among them are *doctype, html, head, body*. Each HTML element has two tag, <> *opening, ... content,* and </ > *closing*. When creating element on HTML we can write an attribute which give additional information for the element, it can determine the behavior of element itself. Each element can become a child for the element itself, for the example`<head>` and `<body>` was the child-element from `<html>.`

HTML document needs fundamental structure for displaying the web pages correctly.  As mention earlier, there's a basic structure will explain below.
1. **`<DOCTYPE html>`** is a format refering the version of HTML and contain a groups of rules need to be adhering on building a website better.
2. **`<html>`** is an element used for telling the browser that this is a HTML document.
3. **`<head>`** is an element function to stores HTML document information, that includes some element like *meta, style, icon* or *link*.
4. **`<body>`** is an element which contain a web pages content.

## In-depth with HTML
After finished the introduction for web structuring, now its time to coverage some part on HTML more deeply. On this part it will cover ==*element variation==, ==built semantic web pages==, ==grouping element with generic==, ==tables==* and *==input element for forms==*.

### Paragraph
This element is a fundamental element from text documents. In HTML, paragraph can be written using tag **`<p>text here</p>`** element. When using this element, the browser will displayed *new line* with space bellow the content.

> Make sure to always use HTML element while displaying the content that includes on document. Because the text or content without element is called *anonymous text*.

### Heading
For indicating the title or sub-title from the content, heading will be helpful. On HTML heading start with **`<h1>, <h2>, <h3>, <h4>, <h5>, <h6>`** that can be used. The larger number for headings, the **boldest** font will be.

### List
Not all text comes with paragraph or even headings, list can be used too for listing the content. In HTML there's three types of list:
1. ***Unordered lists***, which list that shows unordered. Also, we can do nested list here.
```
	<ul>
		<li>Pukis</li>
		<li>Pancong</li>
		<li>Siomay</li>
		<li>
			Nasi
			<ul>
				<li>Nested</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>

	Output: (comes with bullet)
	- Pukis
	- Pancong
	- Siomay
	- Nasi
		- Nested
```

2. ***Ordered lists***, which list that shows in ordered. Works like unordered, but shows numbers (automatically) instead of bullets.
```
	<ol>
		<li>First</li>
		<li>Second</li>
		<li>Third</li>
	</ol>

	Output: (comes with number)
	1. First
	2. Second
	3. Third
```

> This type of list, the order type can be customized using attribute ***types***. Some of them are, *number (default) which also can determine the start, uppercase, lowercase, roman numbering*.

1. ***Description lists***, which list that created from some term to follow.

### Images
To show images on HTML documents, tag **`<img>`** can be used. This element don't need opening or closing tag. Things need to attention is the attribute for the element itself, example **`src`** attribute for the source of image to show which contain the value of image path or URLs.
```
<img src="path/to/images.jpg" alt="alternative text" width="..px" height="..px"> 
```

When setting the size of the image, **`width`** and **`height`** can be used for that. It's recommend using only one of them, except the height and width value already determine.

### Inline Formatting Text
Part to cover special text format for web pages. There are **`<blockquote>, <pre>,`** and **`<figure>`**.

#### Long Quotations
If the content of web pages has quote, *long quotations* can be use using tag **`<blockquote>`**. 
```
<blockquote>
	<p>
		Long text content here...
	</p>
</blockquote>
```

#### Pre-formatted Text
