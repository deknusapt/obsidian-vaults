Markup language that will be used to built a web pages, Hypertext Markup Language. As it says, HTML analogous as a structure. On this part will be introduce to HTML in depth.

## Root Project Directory
When creating a web pages, we only need is a project folder. Inside the folder or project directory we need a HTML file which end up with .html as extension for naming the files. 

## Structure & Anatomy
HTML has a basic structure, among them are *doctype, html, head, body*. Each HTML element has two tag, <> *opening, ... content,* and </ > *closing*. When creating element on HTML we can write an attribute which give additional information for the element, it can determine the behavior of element itself. Each element can become a child for the element itself, for the example`<head>` and `<body>` was the child-element from `<html>.`

> For further reading references from MDN Web Docs:
> - [HTML attributes reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes)
> - [HTML elements reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element)

HTML document needs fundamental structure for displaying the web pages correctly.  As mention earlier, there's a basic structure will explain below.
1. **`<DOCTYPE html>`** is a format refering the version of HTML and contain a groups of rules need to be adhering on building a website better.
2. **`<html>`** is an element used for telling the browser that this is a HTML document.
3. **`<head>`** is an element function to stores HTML document information, that includes some element like *meta, style, icon* or *link*.
4. **`<body>`** is an element which contain a web pages content.

## In-depth with HTML
After finished the introduction for web structuring, now its time to coverage some part on HTML more deeply. On this part it will cover ==*element variation==, ==built semantic web pages==, ==grouping element with generic==, ==tables==* and *==input element for forms==*.

### Paragraph
This element is a fundamental element from text documents. In HTML, paragraph can be written using tag **`<p>text here</p>`** element. When using this element, the browser will displayed *new line* with space bellow the content.

> Make sure to always use HTML element while displaying the content that includes on document. Because the text or content without element is called *anonymous text*.

### Heading
For indicating the title or sub-title from the content, heading will be helpful. On HTML heading start with **`<h1>, <h2>, <h3>, <h4>, <h5>, <h6>`** that can be used. The larger number for headings, the **boldest** font will be.

### List
Not all text comes with paragraph or even headings, list can be used too for listing the content. In HTML there's three types of list:
1. ***Unordered lists***, which list that shows unordered. Also, we can do nested list here.
```
<ul>
  <li>Pukis</li>
    <li>Pancong</li>
    <li>Siomay</li>
  <li>
    Nasi
    <ul>
      <li>Nested</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

> Output: (comes with bullet)
  - Pukis
  - Pancong
  - Siomay
  - Nasi
    - Nested
```

2. ***Ordered lists***, which list that shows in ordered. Works like unordered, but shows numbers (automatically) instead of bullets.
```
<ol>
  <li>First</li>
  <li>Second</li>
  <li>Third</li>
</ol>

> Output: (comes with number)
  1. First
  2. Second
  3. Third
```

> This type of list, the order type can be customized using attribute ***types***. Some of them are, *number (default) which also can determine the start, uppercase, lowercase, roman numbering*.

1. ***Description lists***, which list that created from some term to follow.

### Images
To show images on HTML documents, tag **`<img>`** can be used. This element don't need opening or closing tag. Things need to attention is the attribute for the element itself, example **`src`** attribute for the source of image to show which contain the value of image path or URLs.
```
<img src="path/to/images.jpg" alt="alternative text" width="..px" height="..px"> 
```

When setting the size of the image, **`width`** and **`height`** can be used for that. It's recommend using only one of them, except the height and width value already determine.

### Inline Formatting Text
Part to cover special text format for web pages. There are **`<blockquote>, <pre>,`** and **`<figure>`** (*semantic HTML for organizing content*).

#### Long Quotations
If the content of web pages has quote, *long quotations* can be use using tag **`<blockquote>`**. 
```
<blockquote>
  <p>
    Long text content here...
  </p>
</blockquote>
```

#### Pre-formatted Text
There's an element to make the content displayed how it typed on text editor. It's called *pre-formatted* with tag **`<pre>`**.
```
<pre>
    Poetry

Lorem lorem lorem
lorem lorem lorem

lorem lorem lorem
lorem lorem lorem

    Courtsy: PoetryMan
</pre>
```

#### Figure
This element used to represent the content itself (*self-contained content*), as the example; ilustration, diagram, picture, or even a code block. figure with tag **`<figure>`** its used to grouping content block which can move from main position without taking effect from the main block.
```
<figure>
  <img src="path/to/img.jpeg width="200px">
  <figcaption>Pictures</figcaption>
</figure>
```

After known some implementation of semantic HTML for big content organizing. Now it's time to for inline text formatting. At it's standard, HTML element has two characteristics which come as ***block*** and ***inline***. 

#### Anchor
Is an element which used for creating a hyperlink for content on web pages. It can be use for directing to another website, files, mail or other URLs available online. To use it, tag **`<a>`** comes to play with some mandatory attribute like **`href`** as the state of target.
```
<p>Contact Us!</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https/example/com">Website</a></li>
  <li><a href="mailto:/example/com">Mail</a></li>
  <li><a href="tel:+62123456">Phone</a></li>
  <li><a href="#address">Address</a></li>
</ul>
```

#### Emphasized Text
Element **`<em>`** used to indicate which part of phrase needs to be *point out*. Same as doing an italic for text.
```
<p><em>Hello</em> everyone</p>
```

^Emphasized

#### Important Text
This element is used to point out the text which come as *important* thing. The tag will be **`<strong>`** and create the text bold.
```
<p>Don't forget to <strong>breath!</strong></p>
```

#### Short Quotations
Which used to create a quote as its called, the element needs **`<p>`** for marking the text that will be quoting using **`<q>`**. It's different from **`<blockquote>`**, this element used for inline content.
```
<p>John Adams: <q>How can I help you></q></p>
```

The content will displayed with *quotation marks* in browser. 

#### Citation
Other than an attribute, **`<cite>`** also an element which can be used for referring something. 
```
<p>For further reading, hit this <cite><a href="to/the/links>>Google Scholar</a></cite></p>
```

#### Defining Terms
Element with tag **`<dfn>`** used to define a term and need to be put between other element. The result same as [[02. Intro & In-depth HTML#^Emphasized]].
```
<p><dfn>Internet</dfn> stands for Interconected Network</p>
```

#### Subscript and Superscript
The element subscript with **`<sub>`** tag and superscript with **`<sup>`** tag. It's used to create a math or chemist formula. Sub for bottom position and Sup in vice versa.
```
<p>Molecule formula for water: H<sub>2</sub>O</p>
<p>Pyhisic formula for mass energy: E=MC<sup>2</sup></p>
```

#### Highlighted Text
This element used to marks the text using **`<mark>`** tag. It can be used for referring some text which has *important* or *relevant* information.
```
<p>
  This session is <mark>mandatory</mark> according to its 
  materials that will be deliver to all the students.
</p>
```

#### Line Break
Sometimes, new line will needed for some text also paragraph and browser would ignore the written text with double spacing or new line. So, *inline line break* with **`<br>`** comes to fix that.
```
<p>
  Outofnowhere Space,<br>
  Forbidden Streetimportant 505. 
</p>
```

## Semantic HTML: Organize Content Pages
The website has a ***content hierarchy***. This is important part of a website and of course the element inside HTML document needs to be groups into some part.

### Header and Footer
As an anatomy, a website same as human body it has head which come as ***header*** and their foot come as ***footer***, those element appears inside the **`<body>`** section.
```
<header>
  <h1>Cajuput Spa</h1>
    <p>Welcome to Our Spa</p>
	<nav>
	  <ul>
		<li><a href="Home">Home</a></li>
		<li><a href="Service">Services</a></li>
		<li><a href="Reserve">Reservation</a></li>
	  </ul>
	</nav>
</header>

....

<footer>
  Created with Love, Cajuput Spa.
</footer>
```

^Header

Besides that, this element can be used for **`<article>`** element, which header will contain the title and its writer, the footer contain a links to share the article into social media let's say.
```
<article>
  <header>
	<h1>The Impact of AI</h1>
    <h2>By: The Verge</h2>
  </header>
  <p>
	<!-- The article content here... -->
  </p>
  <footer>
	<p>Share this article through</p>
	<ul>
	  <li><a href="X">Twitter</a></li>
	  <li><a href="Facebook">Facebook</a></li>
	</ul>
  </footer>
</article>
```

^Header-Footer

> Need to know, that this two element can't be nested written.

### Main
This element used to stored the main content from inside the **`<body>`**. The **`<main>`** can include many section, article or every content inside the main, as long the content is main part which website had.
```
 <body>
   <header>
     <!-- header content-->
   </header>
   <main>
     <!-- website main content -->
   </main>
   <footer>
     <!-- footer content -->
   </footer>
</body>
```

### Nav
This element often used to stored navigation content which become major needs for the website, start with **`<nav>`**. It can also be implement on [[#^Header]] section.

### Articles
This element with **`<article>`** tag, act as a container for *independent content* from a pages, which mean a whole article that's not related with other content.  The implementation can be look up at [[02. Intro & In-depth HTML#^Header-Footer]] section.

> If there is an element which contain articles, those each articles should be inside a article element. Also, this element can be written nested as long it's related to their parent.

### Aside
Element with **`<aside>`** tag has two goals, it depends on how to put it from inside another **`<article>`** element or not. 

When the element its placed inside **`<article>`** element, this element can contains information that related with that article, but is not part from the article content itself. Once its placed  outside **`<article>`** element, this element can contains information that related for all pages.

>**`<aside>`** element often placed beside from an element who holds it.

```
<aside>
  <article>
	<header>
	  <h1>The Impact of AI</h1>
	  <h2>By: The Verge</h2>
	</header>
	  <p>
		<!-- The article content here... -->
	  </p>
	<footer>
	  <p>Share this article through</p>
	    <ul>
		  <li><a href="X">Twitter</a></li>
		  <li><a href="Facebook">Facebook</a></li>
		</ul>
	</footer>
  </article>
</aside>
```

### Section
An element which has content similarity and a heading inside, can be groups with **`<section>`** element. Inside a section should be have heading element (*h1 - h6*) which can be first element written on a section to show things like title from each grouped content.
```
<article>
  <section>
	<h2>Article Title One</h2>
	<p>
	  <!-- Article content -->
	</p>
  </section>
  <section>
	<h2>Article Title Two</h2>
	<p>
	  <!-- Article content -->
	</p>u
  </section>
</article>
```

## Generic Element
After finished some other elements. This section will explain about two types general element which can be customized for represent the content correctly.

> There is two types of *generic element*, **`<div>`** and **`<span>`**.

### Div
First, **`<div>`** element is a container which is general in accommodating some content. This could helpful for styling.

> This element often used for grouping a content so that become easier when *styling* using **class** or **id** attribute.

### Span
Second, **`<span>`** element gives the same benefit as **`<div>`**. The difference is, it used for *phrase elements* and there is no *line breaks* while used it. 

> Simply put, this element is used inside a line text which can accommodated by *paragraph, list, heading, etc*.

## Tables
On website there will be some information displayed with form of tables. When creating a table, it will play with rows and columns. Element with **`<table>`** tag represent the tabular data which is a information that presented as a table.

### Table Fundamental Structures
In HTML, a table arranged with three elements which come as **`<table>`, `<tr>`** and **`<td>`** or **`<th>`**. The **`<table>`** element is used to indicate the starting and ending of a table content, then **`<tr>`** comes for creating a new rows which contain **`<td>`** or **`<th>`** inside of it and result as a cells.

> **`<td>`** element means *table data*. Apart from the function to create a cells, this element also a place to store data and **`<th>`** for *table header* used to specify the header in data columns.

```
	  +---------------------------------------------+
	  |		              <table>                   |
	  +----------------------+----------------------+
<tr>  | <th>Header Cell</th> |   <th>Country</th>   |  </tr>
	  +----------------------+----------------------+   <-- Rows
<tr>  |  <th>Data Cell</th>  |  <th>Indonesia</th>  |  </tr>
	  +----------------------+----------------------+
```

Based on illustration above, here's the example structure on HTML:
```
<h1>This is a table</h1>

<table>
  <tr>
	<th>Header Cell</th>
	<th>Country</th>	
  </tr>
  <tr>
	<td>Data Cell</td>
	<td>Indonesia</td>
  </tr>
</table>
```

### Spanning Cells
Sometimes, a cells needs two and more columns or rows. On HTML to merge a cells can be done by using *spanning cell*, and with this the tables can be more complex but this would be hard to read the markup written.

#### Column Spans
This attribute called **`colspan`** used to spanning the column which can be placed inside **`<td>`** or **`<th>`** element.

#### Row Spans
To used spanning row, **`rowspan`** attribute can be placed the way column spans have done. This will give the element to expand their rows based on how much the row element available.

### Element and Attribute for Table
There's another element and attribute that can be used for table.

| Element & Attribute                      | Description                                                      |

| -**`headers`**                           | Data cells association with header                               |
| **`th`**                                 | To set header related with rows and column                       |
| -**`colspan`**                           | The column covered by header                                     |

| -**`headers`**                           | Header association with another header                           |
| -**`scope="row,col,rowgroup,colgroup"`** | To associate header with row, row group, column, or column group |
| **`tr`**                                 | To set table row                                                 |
| **`caption`**                            | To set table title                                               |

## User Inputs
The data which inputted by a user can be done on HTML. For the example, the form login or register has a form which can be filled by the user to type their credentials to access for certain feature on a website. Almost every website available online has their input element, the data input will be processed for website operational needs.

### Input Elements
Element with **`<input>`** tag often used to gather users data. This element have so many types of input which each of them supported by special attribute.
```
<div>
  <label for="email">Email</label>
  <br />
  <input type="email" id="email" placeholder="example@mail.com" required />
</div>

<div>
  <label for="password">Password</label>
  <br />
  <input type="password" id="password" placeholder="********" required />
</div>
```

There's some attribute often used to create a forms page.

| Attribute          | Type                                                         | Description                                                                           |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`name`**         | All                                                          | Used to give a name for input element. This is important for sending input to server. |
| **`placeholder`**  | Text, search, url, tel, mail, password, number               | This will give a low opacity text inside the form, work as hint.                      |
| **`required`**     | All, except hidden, range, color, and button                 | Used to make the input mandatory to fill and cannot leave empty.                      |
| **`value`**        | All, except images                                           | This gives default inputs.                                                            |
| **`autocomplete`** | All, except checkbox, radio, and button                      | This attribute will automatically filled the forms.                                   |
| **`maxlength`**    | Text, search, url, tel, mail, password                       | Used to set the maximum characters allowed.                                           |
| **`max`**          | Date, month, week, time, datetime-local, number, range       | Used to set the maximum value allowed.                                                |
| **`minlength`**    | Text, search, url, tel, mail, password                       | Used to set the minimum characters allowed.                                           |
| **`min`**          | Date, month, week, time, datetime-local, number, range       | Used to set the mainimum value allowed.                                               |

| **`accept`**       | FIles                                                        | Guidance for allowed file formats to be inputted.                                     |
| **`multiple`**     | Mail, files                                                  | Possibilities to multiple input choices.                                              |
| **`pattern`**      | Text, search, url, tel, mail, password                       | Identify the mandatory pattern needs to obeyed by the data for validation.            |
| **`readonly`**     | All, except hidden, range, color, checkbox, radio and button | Don't have any edit value access.                                                     |
| **`disabled`**     | All                                                          | Gives inactive effect to the form, so it can't be filled.                             |

To set types of input is very important, that gives the ability for users which form to type with something that related to their function.

> - [Help users enter the right data into forms](https://web.dev/learn/forms/validation/)

## Sending Forms Data
Form pages are created for users to be filled with the right input, and the system will get their data for operational. The data will be sent to the server for further processed. 

When the client needs a resources to display the website for users, it will send a *request* to the server about what it needs. Talking about sending data through forms, it will needs one essentials element on building a forms which work as *wrapper* for all the inputs column or form, and it is **`<form>`** element.
```
<form>
  <div>
    <label for="email">Email</label>
	  <br/>
	<input type="email" name="email" id="email" />
  </div>

  <div>
    <label for="password">Password</label>
      <br/>
    <input type="password" name="password" id="password" />
  </div>

  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
```

#### Name Attribute on Inputs Element
Sending the data to the server will need to implement **`name`** attribute for all input column on a forms. Each data will be sent in *key* and *value*, the key is identity from sent data and the value is user inputs data. This will gives ability for the server to get the data based on theirs key.

1. ***Action Attribute***, which determine the destination address for data transmission. It can be a URLs which leads to the server or often called as an APIs.
```
