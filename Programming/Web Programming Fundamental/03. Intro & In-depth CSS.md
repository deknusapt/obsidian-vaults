On this module will covering some styling from Cascading Style Sheet. Styling is important thing to a web pages, it becomes a standard by W3C for setting document visualization which written using HTML.

> CSS known as *declarative language* which used to declare a value used to decorate visual of HTML in browser.

The benefit of using CSS for website:
1. Can control and implement precision layout
2. Avoid repetitive work for styling
3. Supported by many browsers

## How Style Sheet Works?
A style sheet work starting from HTML document which have tag element, writing styling guide to decide visual element, and attaching those styling guide into HTML document.

> **`<div>`** element used to give a styling guide for the content they wrap up to have visually better.

## Writing Styling Guide
Writing a styling guide made up with one or more guide, it is called with ***rules*** and ***rule-sets*** which describe the way an element visualize inside a browser.

The first step to learn CSS is to understand a *rule* part. For example, to state the color for **`<h1>`** element and set the font size on paragraph element.
```
h1 {
  color: green;
}

p {
  font-size: small;
  font-family: sans-serif;
}
```

There's **two parts** to create a rule. First, choosing the *selector* which element to implement the rule. Second, declaring the instructions will be implement by a selector.
```
Selector  Declaration
   |      |     |
   v      v     v
   h1{color: green;}
        |       |
        v       v
     Property Value
```

```
Selector  Declaration Block
   |           |     
   v           |     
   p{          v
     font-size: small;
     font-family: sans-serif;
   }
```

### Selector
The selector is called from element type and it's common use. A declaration will be implemented for all the element that has been given a property and it's value.

### Declarations
On declarations there will be a property with their values, and on every declaration needs to be ended up with *semicolon* (;). Remember that CSS it's doesn't care with spacing, so would be better to write new property on new line.
```
p{            
  font-size: small;
  font-family: sans-serif;
	   
  /* new property, write it on new line*/
}
```

## Attaching a Styling on HTML Document
After understanding the way to write a rules, this section will cover on how to attach those rules into HTML document. Actually, there is three ways in implemented styling on HTML element, ***External Style Sheet***, ***Embedded Style Sheet***, and ***Inline Style***.

### External Style Sheet
Using this way will split the CSS rules into another independent documents. The document will use **.css** as the extension that will be connected with HTML document. This way is the most powerful on implemented the styling. 

> To connect **.css** files into HTML, can be done using **`<link>`** element with **`rel`** attribute (*relationship*) inside the **`<head>`** element. This can be used to connect local style sheet files or even online.

```
<head>
  <!-- Import css files -->
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="path/to/styles.css">
</head>
```

### Embedded Style Sheet
Is a set of rules which written inside the HTML document with **`<style>`** element involved. With this method, only those file with styling written inside can have the visual to be set. This **`<style>`** element can be placed inside **`<head>`** element on HTML document.
```
<head>
  <title>Document Title</title>
    <style>
      /*
      * Rules styling here
      */
    </style>
</head>
```

### Inline Style
This method will implement the styling directly on HTML element, using **`<style>`** attribute. 
```
<h1 style="color: green">Content</h1>
```

> To multiply the styling properties, can be done inside the same attribute. But, *semicolon* (;) is utilize as the separator.

## CSS Conception
There's some concepts on CSS should be understanding before deep dive into the details with styling.

### Inheritance
HTML styling tend to be *inheritance* which mean it can be inherit some styles properties from a element to another inside. For the example, the CSS rules which implemented on **`<body>`** element will also implement to all the child-elements automatically.

### Group Selector
If some different selectors has the same properties implementation, then it can be merge using *group selector*. Which can minimize repetitive code writing.
```
h2{
  color: #00A2C4;
}
h3{
  color: #00A2C4;
}

/* can be written into group selector */

h2, h3{
  color: #00A2C4;
}
```

### Rule Order
According to its name, this concept is the way of CSS read the code. It's *cascading* from above to the bottom. So, it's very important to take a look while writing the code, because when conflict appears it is causing by the implemented styling inside the same HTML document and overrides other styling rules.

> To make a *styling property* considered as important by a browser, it can be done by adding keyword **important** at the end of the property value.

```
p{
  color: red !important;
}
```

## In-depth with CSS
Previously, already know with fundamental concepts of CSS like the syntax, how it works, inheritance, grouping selector, and rule order. But there's so many things to learn about CSS in-depth.

### Basic Selector
There's so many selector types that can be used for targeting the rules to certain element on HTML document.

#### Type Selector
This selector use the element name as a target for implemented the rules. When using this selector, the rule will be applied to all the target element.
```
/* the text inside <span> element will become red*/
span{
  color: red;
}
```

#### Class Selector
This selector set the element target based on value of *class attribute*. To write a selector, starting with dot (.) and continue with its class name.
```
> HTML:
<p class="fancy">Content here...</p>

> CSS:
.fancy{
  font-weight: bold;
  text-shadow: 4px 4px 3px #77f;
}
```

> The class tend to be *shareable* means that can be use to another variety elements. Also, each element can have more than one class value to applied.

```
        1st Class
            |
<p class="fancy great-color">Content here...</p>
                     |
                 2nd Class
```
